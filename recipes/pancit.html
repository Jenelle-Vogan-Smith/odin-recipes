        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Traditional Filipino noodle dish.  This crowd-pleaser is always served during Fiesta, birthday parties, and other special occasions.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 packages of thin rice noodles</li>
                    <li>Chicken stock (a pot full)</li>
                    <li>1 lb of pork, cut into small thin slices</li>
                    <li>1 lb of chicken, cut into small thin slices</li>
                    <li>1/2 lb medium sized shrimp, deveined and tails removed (I also cut mine in half)</li>
                    <li>4-5 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
                    <li>1 cup of carrots, julienned</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of celery, diced</li>
                    <li>2 cups cabbage, shredded</li>
                    <li>Scallions</li>
                    <li>Adobo seasoning</li>
                    <li>Soy sauce</li>
                    <li>Patis (optional)</li>
                    <li>Cooking oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring the chicken stock to a low boil, once it's boiling remove it from the heat for about 5-10 minutes.  Once it's cooled down bit, submerge the rice noodles until soft.  This shouldn't take more than 10-12 minutes.  Once they're soft remove them from stock and set aside.  Keep the stock, you'll need it later.</li>
                    <li>Over medium heat, in a large skillet or wok, add chicken, pork, shrimp, onions and garlic.  Lightly coat with oil and add soy sauce, adobo and patis at this time.  (Note: patis is strong, a little goes a long way)</li>
                    <li>When mixture is almost fully cooked, add carrots and celery.  I add these at this point so they don't get overly mushy, but if you like you like them softer you can always add them in step 2 instead.  Continue cooking for another 2-5 minutes.  If there is extra oil/liquid, I drain MOST of it at this point, but you want to keep enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Return wok to burner and turn heat to low.  Add the cabbage and softened pancit noodles at this time.  I also usually add more soy sauce and patis here too.  Mix well.  Cover with lid and cook another 15-20 minutes.  Stir and add more liquid (I use the stock from step 1) as needed.</li>
                    <li>Serve and garnish with scallions.  Some people also like to squeeze lemon juice on it too.</li>
                    <li>Devour!</li>

                </ol>
